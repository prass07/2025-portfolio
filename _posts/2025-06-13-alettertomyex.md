# Subject: A Letter to My Ex

**Dear Ex,**

Thank you.  
I’m a better person now. I sleep peacefully at night. I wake up looking forward to a great day or just a normal one (who even cares anymore?). I don’t overthink like I used to. I’ve learned to go with the flow.  
So, thank you, my ex.

**Wait… who or what is my ex?**

Actually, I’m talking about many exes: the procrastinator, the people-pleaser, the moody version of me, the overthinker, the lazy self who always waited for "the right time."  
Yeah, I broke up with all of them.

### Dear Procrastinator,

You were always convincing me that “later” was better. You had me believing that the stars needed to align for me to start something.  
But now I’ve learned that imperfect action beats perfect hesitation.

### Dear Dependent Me,

You leaned on others for happiness, for motivation, for validation. It was exhausting…  
Today, I know I can be whole on my own. Support is beautiful, but dependence? That’s not love.

### Dear Moody One,

You ruled my day with your mood swings. The world had to tiptoe around us.  
I’ve learned to sit with emotions without becoming them. What a difference that makes.

### And the rest of the ex-crew...

Oh, and a special shoutout to the rest of the ex-crew — Lazy Me who thought scrolling productivity reels was being productive, Insecure Me who panicked over a single “seen” message, Moody Me with emotional whiplash, Overthinker Me who wrote entire novels in my head, and People-Pleaser Me who said yes to everything and resented it later.  
Thanks for the drama, but we’re over — officially.

I don’t hate you. In fact, I’m thankful.  
You were trying to protect me in your own way by avoiding risk, by clinging to comfort. But I outgrew you.  
And for that, I’m grateful.

So this is my goodbye.  
I’ve moved on — better habits, clearer mind, lighter heart... or so I tell myself.  
Dear ex, thank you for the lessons.  
But you’re not needed anymore.

Unless, of course, you never really left.  
And I’m just writing this letter... to pretend I’ve changed.

With love,  
**The maybe new me.**
